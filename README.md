# PowerShellJSONValidator
Validate JSON using PowerShell Script

This is just a simple version of JSON Validator using PowerShell scripting. In case if you need to validate JSON syntax of any text file (you can easily change file format you want to use), just execute script and it will automatically pick all text files available in the script folder to validate.
